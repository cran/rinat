# rinat 0.1.6

* New maintainer: StÃ©phane Guillou (@stragu)
* Improve documentation
* Clean up code according to CRAN feedback
* Note that 0.1.x versions of rinat will only fix existing issues, before a move to the new iNaturalist API with version 0.2 (which is likely to introduce breaking changes).

## New features

* `get_inat_obs()` can now use objects of class `Spatial` or `sf` as a bounding box (#38, @Martin-Jung and #40, @LDalby; fixes #30)
* Allow the use of an iNat `place_id` when searching for observations (commit 1d7f14f, @LDalby)

## Bug fixes

* Lower result number limit when bounding box present (#20)
* Fix result pagination in `get_obs_project()` for cases when the number of results is a multiple of 100 (#1, @vijaybarve)
* Stop `get_inat_obs()` if no search parameter(s) provided (#32, @LDalby)
* Avoid API error by limiting search results to 10000 (#32, @LDalby)
* Fix argument name in `inat_handle()` (#32, @LDalby)
* Use JSON endpoint instead of CSV to avoid `get_inat_obs_project()` failing on some projects (#35, @LDalby and #38, @Martin-Jung; fixes #28 and #37)
* Fix code according to `devtools::check()` feedback in preparation for CRAN release
